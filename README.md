MSCN<sub>NS</sub> (Multi-scale Sub-pixel Convolutional Network with a Neighborhood Smoothness constraint) is a CNN-based approach for monocular depth estimation.

For technical details, please see the paper (comming soon).

## Prerequisites
* python v3.5.x
* pytorch v0.3.0 (or later version)
* numpy
* scipy

## How to test

### Quick test
You may use the provided model (comming soon) and test samples to test this apporach as follows,

```python3 test.py --model <the pytorch model> --image ./test_samples/nyu_v2_175.mat```

### Test on the whole NYU Depth v2 dataset.
